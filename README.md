Final Girl: Movie Marathon Mode
 
V2.0 - Series 2
- Added Series 2 Killers, Locations, and Girls (including Box of Props girls)
- Dynamically populating killer, location, and girl lists
    - Max number of movies is also dynamically set by the number of feature films
- Adjusted some wording to accomodate changes

V1.0 - Initial Design
- Standard gameplay
  - 1-5 game rounds
  - User chosen pool of girls/killers/locations
    - Each category must have at least as many selections as number of rounds
  - Each game round has a randomly chosen and unique girl/killer/location



ToDo/Ideas
-----------

- "select all" buttons
    - perhaps even automatically select all killers/locations if max number of movies is selected
    
- allow addition of custom-created final girls

- maybe widen the movie list so that all entries are on one line

- option to "lock" killers to their locations
    - maybe do this with girls too?
    
- add hover-over info bubbles for the girls with their data

- ability to add in the vignettes (they slot in between feature films and you just use the existing board, kind of like a break in your movie binge)

- options for some alternate game modes/more freedom in selections?
